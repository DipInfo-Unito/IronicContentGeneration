Emergency!"" while one of the boys vomited all over the bus floor, here's my favorite. About a month ago I was leaving the GP with my daughter who was 4 months old and sick, so I had the pram with me to put her in if it started raining and she was strapped to my chest in the carrier because she needs a good cuddle when she's not feeling well. I get on the bus with my pram and go to sit down when the bus driver starts shouting at me that ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!!"". He won't move the bus, and the pram doesn't really fold easily, not to mention how am I supposed to fold it down with a sick baby strapped to me?? I go to explain I can't fold it and the driver just keeps telling me ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!"" I had no choice, I pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said ""it's not unoccupied now."" If I could have held my screaming baba up to that man's ear like a seashell, I would have.

Comment: ""There's not enough details in this post, but let's assume 4 day week to make up 30 hours, that's 8 trips. And maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (I'm being conservative). Average of 9 trips a week then. Let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. That works out 1,216.8 a year. Current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.2=3,600. Let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. With this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability = 16,550 multiplied by 0.2=3,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. Savings of 290 euro. Also save on prsi but 18,000/52=346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on. Finally, USC, the 1,450 would not be subject to USC, so that's 2% of 1,450, = 29 euro. Total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131. That's a saving of 85.8 a year compared to the cost I calculated in my example. Then take into account nitelinks, which are included in the tax saver ticket. And the convenience of it. Even if only on the 2.15 bus fare it would still be worth it in my opinion.

Arndt wants people to think seriously about teen sexuality, not just pretend it doesn't exist, and about the reasons why men commit murder-suicide. It's not for the LOLs, and its not because All Men Are Evil. When somebody, man or woman, kills there own children and then themselves, it's not just a random act of evil. It happens for a reason.

Comment: ""Context: I was recently booted from a perm part time job that I held for a year, after I was made casual 2 weeks prior to being booted and hours going from 20+ a week to 3-6. Placed back into Newstart I was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where I had on my file that ""Essential Skills for Work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course I have ever seen. English is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at $17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under $70). I am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in Python, specifically ML, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch... Mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. I have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. Doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for. None of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. LP Pathways is the name of the provider of this gem. Edit: Bonus image. Parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit. Edit 2, the sequel: It is not too.

If you are looking for a serious relationship, matrimonial websites are the best because you know that people there are looking for something similar.

Comment: ""Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. The memory of the way to defend the body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about. In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

Comment: ""I remember this is when my family and I made the move to Brisbane from UK. it was a bit of a culture shock but there is something special about how 90s Australia felt. I loved going going to an outback school, we ended up in dalby. Guys did 'lappies' in the main street. Underage drinking at Marys pub. (not condoning it) Cigarettes will kill you, MGF, Regurgitator, powderfinger Recovery, custard. nirvana, foo fighters, Pearl jam, yes spice girls lol. Superjesus was my first concert when I was 18 and living with friends in the late 90s. Livid festival. I used to mosh! Holy crap lol. Mates I made.The balmy house parties in suburban Brisbane at uni. $1 drinks. my flatmate watching dawsons creek, going to Lions games with her. Jason Akimanis and Luke Power. most of the 90s I was at school though. In dalby I remember the Great Locust Plague of 1994. And the mouse plague of '93. National anthem at school assembly. heartbreak High, Drazic, X files, and my friend and I used to make cheesy Mulder and Scully birthday cards. Jimeoin and Bobs cooking show. Aussie comedy. four weddings and a funeral. Listening to Lawsie on the radio with my dad on holidays. riding around town on my bike, dropping in on mates. art class. it was the only one I really liked I think, and English, drama. I remember backchatting teachers. Cross Country runs in 35 degree heat. Celing fans. Lynx deorderant. chatting with my best mate outside school for ages about Ab Fab. we gossipped about teachers like Mrs Brown 'how now brownnn cow' as we watched her drive off in her ""Toorak tractor"" we used to say. (its ok, bitchiness was deserved),internet got connected in my house when I was in grade 12, I thought it was the biggest deal to be able to chat to a rando across the world. school camp at Tallebudgera where apparently everyone isn't scared of heights except me. a bat flying into our cabin. my friend screaming. bahaha. Electric blue streaks in my hair. (18) because I thought that was cool ha. qcs exams. excitement about moving out. the last week of school. yearbooks and saying goodbye. two girls wore the same dress to the year 12 formal and it was awkward. schoolies. sorry for the punctuation, good thread.""","Given the following Comment, which of the two following replies is more ironic?

Mosques were destroyed and they raised a Hanuman flag on top of a mosque. The police also took part in this. Then why is it so hard to say that this is a pogrom against Muslim people? There is overwhelming evidence, and has been for a while now. You’re looking at Kashmir, UP, Delhi. All of the statements coming from the government are blatantly islamophobic, BJP supporters are blatantly islamophobic. So why can’t the obvious be stated?
