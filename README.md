## Overview
Generating ironic content is particularly challenging as it demands a deep understanding of context, implicit references, and the delicate balance between seriousness and playfulness. Furthermore, irony is highly subjective, influenced by various social, cultural, and generational factors.

This project explores whether **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can learn to generate ironic responses to social media posts. To investigate this, we fine-tuned two models:

- One model generates **ironic content**.
- The other model generates **non-ironic content**.

We performed a detailed linguistic analysis of the generated outputs, focusing on:
- The relationship between the generated response and the original social media post.
- The linguistic features of irony in the responses.
- The similarity of the generated responses to human-written replies.

The base dataset used for training is [**MultiPico**](https://www.amazon.science/publications/multipico-multilingual-perspectivist-irony-corpus) ([MultiPICo: Multilingual Perspectivist Irony Corpus](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.849) (Casola et al., ACL 2024)), which provides a wide range of social media posts with varied linguistic and cultural contexts.

Additionally, we conducted a **large-scale human evaluation** to assess the effectiveness of the models' ironic content generation.

Moreover, we explored the possibility of LLMs generating irony with a **generational perspective**, yielding mixed results. This suggests that irony can be perceived differently across different age groups, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the task of generating ironic content.
