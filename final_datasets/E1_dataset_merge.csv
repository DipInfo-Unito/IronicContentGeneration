I've got 12 panels, so that's about £416 per panel.
I'm also on a time of use tariff, so I get paid 5.5p per kWh for the electricity I export to the grid, and pay 4.5p per kWh for the electricity I import from the grid.
So, I'm making about £100 per month, and I've got a 3.5kWh battery, so I can use that electricity at night when it's cheaper, and export it back to the grid during the day when it's more expensive.
I've got a 10kW inverter, so I can run my electric car off the panels, and charge it for free.
I've got a 3kW immersion heater, so I can heat my water for free.

So, I'm making about £100 per month, and I've got a 3.5kWh battery, so I can use that electricity at night when it's cheaper, and export it back to the grid during the day when it's more expensive.
I've got a 10kW inverter, so I can run my electric car off the panels, and charge it for free.

I've got 12 panels, so that's about £416 per panel.
I'm also on a time of use tariff, so I get paid 5.5p per kWh for the electricity I export to the grid, and pay 4.5p per kWh for the electricity I import from the grid.
So, I'm making about £100 per month, and I've got a 3.5kWh battery, so I can use that electricity at night when it's cheaper, and export it back to the grid during the day when it's more expensive.
I've got a 10kW inverter, so I can run my electric car off the panels, and charge it for free.
I've got a 3kW immersion heater, so I can heat my water for free.

After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil) Recipe for coconut milk gravy: In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee. Add in chopped tomatoes and mix add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.) mix spices and wait for oil to be released. add 1 can of coconut milk and mix. bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins. Plating: Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer place fried fish use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat) garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs. Peanut Chutney: Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home: Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown peel off any remaining skin pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts. You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture.","I'm not sure if you're joking or not, but I'm going to assume you're not.

Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment) flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat Recipe for rice: Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker). After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil) Recipe for coconut milk gravy: In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee. Add in chopped tomatoes and mix add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.) mix spices and wait for oil to be released. add 1 can of coconut milk and mix. bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins. Plating: Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer place fried fish use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat) garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs. Peanut Chutney: Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home: Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown peel off any remaining skin pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
