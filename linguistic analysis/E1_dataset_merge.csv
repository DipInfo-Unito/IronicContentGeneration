(I’ve been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. He’s no where to be found today. I hope no one believes in conspiracy theories. They’re just unanswered questions with not enough data to reach a conclusion. The troubling thing is, when the data you need comes from the source you suspect of wrong doing then you can either take their word for it, or not trust the data.","How, excuse my french, the f r i c c could you actually beleive that 9/11 was faked, there is very conclusive footage, and proof that it was real, and live video of it was recorded on the news, with several witnesses how is it that despite all of that the government could still get away with it? Nobody noticed any fallacies? And why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? The thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and I guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? What kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored.",I'm not sure about the third tower. I thought it was just the south tower that collapsed.,notironic,Strongly Disagree,-2
