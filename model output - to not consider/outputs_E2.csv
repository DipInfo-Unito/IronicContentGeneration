Peasants starving was not something 19th century regimes normally cared about, be it any of the famines in Ireland or Britain, or anywhere across Europe.

99,fjb70j4,"There's not enough details in this post, but let's assume 4 day week to make up 30 hours, that's 8 trips. And maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (I'm being conservative). Average of 9 trips a week then. Let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. That works out 1,216.8 a year. Current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.2=3,600. Let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. With this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability = 16,550 multiplied by 0.2=3,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. Savings of 290 euro. Also save on prsi but 18,000/52=346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on. Finally, USC, the 1,450 would not be subject to USC, so that's 2% of 1,450, = 29 euro. Total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131. That's a saving of 85.8 a year compared to the cost I calculated in my example. Then take into account nitelinks, which are included in the tax saver ticket. And the convenience of it.

313,fjaddij,"Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. The memory of the way to defend the body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about. In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

Hospital tie-on face masks are designed to stop medical professionals infecting their patient [edit.. and protect the wearer from blood/fluid sprays]. Only the form-fitting P2/N95 rated type protects the wearer [from inhaling particles/viruses]. Edit: source: I have spent many years doing filter/respirator R&D. Some of my papers are cited by 3M (a leading respirator and surgical mask manufacturer) in their technical manuals,"It would seem the right mask to have personal reserves of ought protect in both directions. That is, protecting: the wearer; and others from the wearer.
So for example, if you have a form-fitting disposable P2/N95 mask with a valve this is not going to protect others from your exhalations (although, from personal experience, I've found valves great for bushfire smoke purposes).
