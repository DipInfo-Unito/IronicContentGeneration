Not that I'm justifying a ski holiday being superior to any other kind of holiday or that it's the best choice in relation to a curriculum. However, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. If given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. Colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. Skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in Ireland. This, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. If it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then I think it's absolutely worth it. I don't want to write for ages and make this wall of text any larger, I could talk at length about all the different aspects but I just want to offer an alternative perspective.",neutral,reddit,"I’m sure the child would have loved it.

So much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win. 
RSS propaganda has really brainwashed Hindus tho. I'll give you a simple example. I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
RSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.","Muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years.

545,fj6b4a8,"Panels and inverter cost me £4k all in , fitted.  (4KW system)
Immersun (hot water / heat diverter device) cost me £200 fitted, already had an electric element in the hot water cylinder. 
thinking about going for a battery next, but that will cost more than the whole setup cost. We've had our system for 5 years almost (bought it in 2015) and it's already paid for itself both in savings and the income generated and in theory at least, there's 15 years left to go on my FIT contract (payments) and a life of about the same left on the panels","What did this setup cost you. Would love to go solar but all of the solar panel ""grants"" sound a lot like scams. Not in the conventional sense but that it's not actually the person with the panels who ends up saving anything for 20 odd years",neutral,reddit,"I'm in the UK, so I got a grant of £5000 from the government.
I've got 12 panels, so that's about £416 per panel.
I'm also on a time of use tariff, so I get paid 5.5p per kWh for the electricity I export to the grid, and pay 4.5p per kWh for the electricity I import from the grid.
So, I'm making about £100 per month, and I've got a 3.5kWh battery, so I can use that electricity at night when it's cheaper, and export it back to the grid during the day when it's more expensive.
I've got a 10kW inverter, so I can run my electric car off the panels, and charge it for free.
I've got a 3kW immersion heater, so I can heat my water for free.
I've got a 3kW heat pump, so I can heat my house for free.
