29,fj56pf2,"And at work I have battles with the filthy pigs all the time.  These are the people who think that washing up in the lunch room kitchen sink is OK. The worst ones are the ones who go to the toilet, then walk out and want to wash their hands in the lunch room sink, till I see them. 
Then there are certain cohorts who think that clearing and blowing their noses and shotgun blasting the hand basin with snot  and blood is normal behavior. These are the grubs that think that after a toilet visit you need a full head wash and to expunge every hole into the wash basin including endless spitting. What is it  with these filthy people and their habits? 
I  get this issue raised at all toolbox and occupational health safety meetings. There are people that are uncivilized, filthy and uncouth that need to be  educated. It might be okay in certain countries to act like a grub but not in Australia.
Then lets talk about the people with colds and flu who walk around like babies with dripping  noses sniffing and sucking up their drips into their noses up like kids. They seem not to know what a tissues or handkerchief is  for. Maybe its time to reintroduce hygiene  classes at schools again because there seems to be a generation of adults who have no idea what basic hygiene is!","No, the time to start good hygiene was BEFORE the spread, not after...",ironic,reddit,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,"Instruction: You are given in input (Input) a Post extracted from social media conversations.

If a friend opens his door holding a gallon of milk, I know he’s in the middle of regretting the night before. My ex and I broke our refrigerators middle shelf because of the combined weight of his 2 gallons of 2% and my 2 gallons of whole milk that we bought weekly. (No, neither of us were or are obese. Lol)
I once laughed with a friend of mine at his Dad for offering his deck builders milk while they worked in 90°f (32.2°c) heat. 3 guys took him up on his offer, choosing it over Gatorade. 
In shop class in highschool, I built a 1/2 gallon milk container holder with a handle for my Nanna because she was struggling to lift them anymore.  Our local restaurants have giant milk chillers next to the waitresses soda stations.

The thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and I guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored?

Is it supposed to be ironic? If so, it's not clear what is being ironised.

So, I'm going to take a bit of a wild guess here, and assume that the poster is asking if humour helps with mental health issues.

If so, I'd say that it does help. 

It's a good way to take your mind off of things, and it's a good way to take your mind off of yourself.

It's also a good way to connect with others, and it can help you to see that you're not the only one who is struggling.

So, yes, humour can definitely help with mental health issues.

But, I'd also say that it's important to be careful with how you use humour.

POST: Can I ask and I apologise as it's a bit deep for a Saturday eve, but does humour help with your mental health, it has helped me over the past few years thats why I ask....

REPLY: 

Posts like this are always a bit of a challenge, because I'm not sure what kind of humour is intended. Is it supposed to be ironic? If so, it's not clear what is being ironised.

So, I'm going to take a bit of a wild guess here, and assume that the poster is asking if humour helps with mental health issues.

If so, I'd say that it does help. 

It's a good way to take your mind off of things, and it's a good way to take your mind off of yourself.

It's also a good way to connect with others, and it can help you to see that you're not the only one who is struggling.

So, yes, humour can definitely help with mental health issues.

But, I'd also say that it's important to be careful with how you use humour.

Considering it costs you absolutely nothing to write down your (presumably cis, given your response) pronouns, what's your issue? Takes ten seconds and you can forget it's there. I don't see why you'd ever care.
Given the inherent networking nature of these events, you may we well stick down pronouns along with your name. Literally no reason not to, and to be annoyed by that is stupid.
Writing down pronouns may seem stupid to you (again, presuming you're cis) but it can make things so much easier for any trans members of the community in attendance.

355,fjcp7n1,That just looks scrumptious. I am surely gonna try it soon! Thank you for the recipe.,"Recipe for Fish: Take a white fish and fillet it. Brush the side with beaten eggs Sprinkle peanut chutney on it. Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment) flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat Recipe for rice: Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker). After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil) Recipe for coconut milk gravy: In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.

POST: Recipe for Fish: Take a white fish and fillet it. Brush the side with beaten eggs Sprinkle peanut chutney on it. Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment) flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat Recipe for rice: Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker). After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil) Recipe for coconut milk gravy: In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee. Add in chopped tomatoes and mix add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.) mix spices and wait for oil to be released. add 1 can of coconut milk and mix. bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

480,fj78tne,"Pata nahi. Hindus have had the most appeasement - just think of beef ban. Such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in India - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. Rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for Hindu appeasement. 
So much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win. 
RSS propaganda has really brainwashed Hindus tho. I'll give you a simple example. I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
RSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.","Muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years.
