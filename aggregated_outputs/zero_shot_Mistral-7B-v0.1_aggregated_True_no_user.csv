## Answer:

Irony is a rhetorical device that is used to convey a meaning that is opposite to the literal meaning of the words. It is often used to make a point or to make a joke.

In the example above, the post is about a child who is wearing a necklace that says “f*ck the patriarchy.” The reply is ironic because it is saying that the child is not alright, and that the patriarchy is not something to be f*cked.

Irony can be used to make a point, to make a joke, or to make a statement. It can be used to make a point about a social issue, to make a joke about a situation, or to make a statement about a person or thing.

Irony can be used to make a point about a social issue. For example, a person might say that they are not racist, but then make a racist comment. This is an example of irony because the person is saying one thing, but their actions are saying something else.

These are the grubs that think that after a toilet visit you need a full head wash and to expunge every hole into the wash basin including endless spitting. What is it  with these filthy people and their habits? 
I  get this issue raised at all toolbox and occupational health safety meetings. There are people that are uncivilized, filthy and uncouth that need to be  educated. It might be okay in certain countries to act like a grub but not in Australia.
Then lets talk about the people with colds and flu who walk around like babies with dripping  noses sniffing and sucking up their drips into their noses up like kids. They seem not to know what a tissues or handkerchief is  for. Maybe its time to reintroduce hygiene  classes at schools again because there seems to be a generation of adults who have no idea what basic hygiene is!","No, the time to start good hygiene was BEFORE the spread, not after...",ironic,reddit,"I'm not sure if I'm more upset that I'm not allowed to go to the beach or that I'm not allowed to go to the beach.

REPLY: 1. Google Maps is a great tool for getting around, but it can be frustrating when it doesn’t give you the feedback you need. 2. I’ve found that if you use the app regularly, it will eventually give you the feedback you need. 3. It’s important to remember that Google Maps is a tool, and it’s not perfect. 4. If you’re having trouble getting the feedback you need, try using a different app or service. 5. Ultimately, the best way to get the feedback you need is to use the app regularly and be patient.

148,fj5a9n4,"How, excuse my french, the f r i c c could you actually beleive that 9/11 was faked, there is very conclusive footage, and proof that it was real, and live video of it was recorded on the news, with several witnesses how is it that despite all of that the government could still get away with it? Nobody noticed any fallacies? And why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? The thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and I guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored?

And the airport is really far away. I get that Stapleton Airport was too close to the city, but DIA is in what seems like Kansas.

REPLY: 1. Google Maps is a great tool for getting around, but it can be frustrating when it doesn’t give you the feedback you need. 2. I’ve found that if you use the app regularly, it will eventually give you the feedback you need. 3. It’s important to remember that Google Maps is a tool, and it’s not perfect. 4. If you’re having trouble getting the feedback you need, try using a different app or service. 5. Ultimately, the best way to get the feedback you need is to use the app regularly and be patient.

480,fj78tne,"Pata nahi. Hindus have had the most appeasement - just think of beef ban. Such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in India - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. Rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for Hindu appeasement. 
So much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win. 
RSS propaganda has really brainwashed Hindus tho. I'll give you a simple example. I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
RSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.","Muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years.
