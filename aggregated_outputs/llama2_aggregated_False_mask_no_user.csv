Not that I'm justifying a ski holiday being superior to any other kind of holiday or that it's the best choice in relation to a curriculum. However, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. If given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. Colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. Skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in Ireland. This, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. If it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then I think it's absolutely worth it. I don't want to write for ages and make this wall of text any larger, I could talk at length about all the different aspects but I just want to offer an alternative perspective.",serious,reddit,"No one is saying a ski holiday is the best holiday ever, just that it's a valid choice and that it's not a selfish choice."

After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil) Recipe for coconut milk gravy: In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee. Add in chopped tomatoes and mix add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.) mix spices and wait for oil to be released. add 1 can of coconut milk and mix. bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

Such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in India - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. Rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for Hindu appeasement. 
So much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win. 
RSS propaganda has really brainwashed Hindus tho. I'll give you a simple example. I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
RSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.","Muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years. It is one of the major reasons why Hindus are angry towards the community. With regards to the Population and go to Pakistan points, they are absolute nonsense.
