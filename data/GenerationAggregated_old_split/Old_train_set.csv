Fuck David Attenborough
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/18/david-attenborough-famine-population
Sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, Sir David Attenborough has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
The renowned broadcaster told the Daily Telegraph the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about?"" he said. ""They're about too many people for too little land. That's what it's about. And we are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That's barmy.""
He admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
One area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""To start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children. And who am I to say that you shan't have children? That's one thing,"" he said. ""And the last sensitivity – and the most tricky of all – is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are Africa and Asia, you know.""",iro,reddit

fjaddij,"Thank you!
Upvoting this not because I totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. It's a very interesting read.
OP mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). Well, I need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. Otherwise, it's in the same league of those UN WhatsApp forwards.  
Hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.  
I mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  Google powered research paper.  
Till then, I think it would be best to leave the deductions to the specialists.","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

fj8tzto,">  Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
Why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  In future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'? 
>Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.
Will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.","These reforms are fucking great. I'm so happy. 
• Landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
• Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
• Landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
• Bond will now be capped at four weeks’ rent.
• Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. This covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. But they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
• Landlords will now need an official order from the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
• Tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. The landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
• Victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they aren’t held liable for the debts of their abusers.
• Caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

Fucking rental bidding. I've had to do it. Such a shit of an underhanded practise. Getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested... 
Tell them directly that rent bidding is illegal. Oh, we're not doing that, we're just letting you know there are a lot of people interested...
There are more coming into effect in July 2020: https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/changes-to-renting-laws/all-changes-in-place-from-july-2020
Some highlights:
Inappropriate rental application questions
A rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
Rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
Rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a ‘no specified reason’ notice to vacate. To end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
Evidence for change of use notice to vacate
Rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. The Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
Bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
If a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the Act as though they were the rental provider.
Expanded definition for urgent repairs
Urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
Long-term leases
Renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. They must use the prescribed form to do so.",not,reddit

I loved going going to an outback school, we ended up in dalby. Guys did 'lappies' in the main street. Underage drinking at Marys pub. (not condoning it) Cigarettes will kill you,  MGF, Regurgitator, powderfinger Recovery, custard. nirvana, foo fighters, Pearl jam, yes spice girls lol.

Mates I made.The balmy house parties in suburban Brisbane at uni. $1 drinks.  my flatmate watching dawsons creek, going to Lions games with her. Jason Akimanis and Luke Power.
most of the 90s I was at school though. In dalby I remember the Great Locust Plague of 1994. And the mouse plague of '93. National anthem at school assembly. heartbreak High, Drazic, X files, and my friend and I used to make cheesy Mulder and Scully birthday cards. Jimeoin and Bobs cooking show. Aussie comedy. four weddings and a funeral. Listening to Lawsie on the radio with my dad on holidays. riding around town on my bike, dropping in on mates. art class. it was the only one I really liked I think, and English, drama. I remember backchatting teachers. Cross Country runs in 35 degree heat. Celing fans. Lynx deorderant. chatting with my best mate outside school for ages about Ab Fab. we gossipped about teachers like Mrs Brown 'how now brownnn cow' as we watched her drive off in her ""Toorak tractor"" we used to say. (its ok, bitchiness was deserved),internet got connected in my house when I was in grade 12, I thought it was the biggest deal to be able to chat to a rando across the world.  school camp at Tallebudgera where apparently everyone isn't scared of heights except me. a bat flying into our cabin. my friend screaming. bahaha. Electric blue streaks in my hair. (18) because I thought that was cool ha. qcs exams. excitement about moving out. the last week of school.  yearbooks and saying goodbye. two girls wore the same dress to the year 12 formal and it was awkward.  schoolies. sorry for the punctuation, good thread.",not,reddit

fjcehst,That is hilarious and horrifying.  Thank you for the travel warning.,"They could be everywhere, but the vast majority aren't pest species that interact with humans; most that do live here (if any) are probably all hiding out in the woods and gorse and all and staying the fuck away from people. 
I think for pest species it's the German cockroaches that you'd find here the most, but they aren't native; usually they get brought over in shipments or in people's luggage and then go on to infest the surrounding buildings. Even the pest ones are very skittish and good at hiding, so your building could easily be full of 'em without you noticing for a long time, and if you see one, he almost certainly has a few thousand close relatives nearby out of sight. 
If you really want to see cockroaches for some strange reason, just head to the southeast US and you'll see some shit all right. I once spotted one in the kitchen in the house I grew up in down in Florida because I was in the sitting room watching TV and I heard it walking around. I dropped a cereal bowl on top of it and went to go grab something to capture it with, and when I got back the entire fucking bowl was trundling across the kitchen floor; that thing gave no fucks. 
Oh, and did I mention some of the bigger ones (yes, there were bigger ones) fly? Back in Georgia I had a nest of 'em take up residence on my roof once, and every now and again one would get lost up there and fall down the chimney or the bathroom vent.

>>RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). 
We are currently low risk.  We have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the Diamond Princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. While highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  Our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

Coughing, sneezing and spreading germs everywhere and infecting their colleagues. Not to mention what this will do to the morale and panic levels now that we have Corona Virus to worry about. 
It seems to have become the norm now that unless your leg is falling off, you need to show up. It's fucking stupid, usually people are incredibly unproductive when that sick and they end up making a rake of other employees sick which in turn has a much bigger impact on productivity and company profits than if they had stayed at home in bed and properly recovered. 
We can't be calling in sick when we only have a dose of the sniffles or relatively minor ailments but some common sense from employees and bosses would go a long way to curbing the spread of this virus and the spread of seasonal flus in general. 
You'd hope that most large companies are developing action plans and counter measures at the moment. Protocols on what to do if members of staff are ill, asking people to go or to remain at home, encouraging employees who don't need to be physically present to work from home where possible. 
I'm mostly talking about standard, non customer facing office jobs here. I do understand for a lot of unfortunate people, this would be impractical due to a lack of sick pay allowance or the nature of their job means that it can't be done remotely. Then there's the huge percentage of people who simply can't afford to miss even one day without suffering financially.

An Post are usually very good at getting things to the correct person. If you're at 50 Fitzwilliam Street and they send it to 15 Witzfillian Road, I'd say it'll get to you.
There's not much that they can do to trace you, but if the same inspector catches you again, he might call the guards. If you're found guilty in the District Court of deliberately evading your fare (and while the inspector has accepted you acted in error, rather than fraudulently, by purchasing a student ticket you weren't entitled to and gave you a Standard Fare Notice instead of prosecuting; if you've given him a false name and address that is an attempt to evade your fare) you face a fine of up to €1000 plus costs.

fj5hpfp,"Sure, it ended up being the wrong decision. 
I work in operations and logistics, and I’m involved with accommodation and people living in close quarters. 
Keeping people on the ship was really the only decision that could’ve been made at the time. There would’ve been no scenario in which the government or any other organisation would’ve recommended removing everyone from the ship and placing them quarantine somewhere else. 
It looks bad in hindsight, but the key priority would’ve been to minimise the spread of the virus among the greater population of Japan and Asia, not among the cruise ship passengers themselves. I know that sounds a bit morbid, but it’s accurate and they did mostly contain the virus to the ship itself. 
People also underestimate how hard it would have been to find any other accommodation or grounds that would’ve been a better choice. You’re talking about finding an isolated place, with thousands of individual rooms, already empty, ready to receive, feed, and treat thousands of people - all within a small enough distance from the ship as to not risk the public. It’s almost impossible at short notice.","Yes, the Japanese government really fucked that up. Locking everyone on the ship meant far more people caught it.",not,reddit

This isn’t a case of both sides.

Mosques were destroyed and they raised a Hanuman flag on top of a mosque. The police also took part in this. 
Then why is it so hard to say that this is a pogrom against Muslim people? There is overwhelming evidence, and has been for a while now. You’re looking at Kashmir, UP, Delhi.

fj9gxri,Thanks for the information! Hope I can navigate all this well!,"Firstly 28 isn't old, so don't tell yourself that! 
Dating websites in India are a mess, however if you had to pick Bumble might be the best of the lot. Bumble doesn't allow men to initiate a conversation once they match, only women can. Aisle isn't bad, but it's got an awful interface and most things need you to pay.
If you are looking for a serious relationship, matrimonial websites are the best because you know that people there are looking for something similar. I would strongly suggest creating the profile by yourself and being in control of it. Most websites allow a filter for who is handling the account, seeing profiles handled by parents/friends can be an no no for people.

Because of how famous it is, it attracts all sorts of crowd. Personally I thought it had a creepy vibe.... more scope of getting pervy messages. I would be a little careful here.
Hinge - Hinge is the most favored one, the crowd is fairly decent. The platform itself encourages open discussions and keeps the conversation fun and engaging. Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe. Though they are good I didn't find many guys who were looking for ""marriage"" they were open to dating, meeting and taking it from there. Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.
Matrimony sites - Shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. It allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. The agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... Though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out.

Hopefully it will eventually get built. Once we have one others will follow.

None of the drugs had been decriminalised but the state has recognised an epidemic and offered a safer system to those at the highest risk levels.
I don't think at this point decriminalization would do shit. we've an rooted black market supply chain that isn't going anywhere, best thing the state can do is provide early education into the long term effects of drug use, heavily change the support infrastructure for those caught in addiction cycles and stop treating em like dregs and leaving em in back alleys.",not,reddit

fj7btdx,"Completely understand your sentiment. It's tough. You're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. Very frustrating. 
Absolutely, I'm loyal to a fault and if I make plans with someone I will always stick to them unless I'm sick or something. Very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.","Making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. Being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. I agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. It’s very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. Just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
On the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, I’ve gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once I find out he’s straight. Yet there is a general sense of unease when I meet new straight guys, I think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they don’t think I’m in any way coming on to them at all, I would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. So baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because I’m over-compensating for them knowing I’m gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything I may do or say.
Clearly I’m reading a lot into it here, but I ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. The friends I have made as an adult have been through work and one guy I did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship.

fj5ddym,Apparently the timelines don't match at all. His mother didn't meet him until after Trudeau was born. The rebuttal I saw also had pictures of young Pierre Trudeau to Justin Trudeau and they're similar.,"Fidel Castro being Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's father.
The resemblance really is uncanny (he looks nothing like his supposed biological father) and when you see that the dates his mom was staying with the Castros in Cuba, everything really does line up.  She also had numerous affairs rumors with people like Mick Jagger while she was married.  She really had a history of getting around and partying at places like Studio 54, etc.",not,reddit

fjcju5l,"Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. 
However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. 
I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.","The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
If you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.",not,reddit

fj7ha0g,The wage calculation test is correct if your a “wage” theft employer.

Placed back into Newstart I was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where I had on my file that ""Essential Skills for Work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course I have ever seen.  
English is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at $17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under $70). I am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in Python, specifically ML, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
Mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. I have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. Doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
None of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. LP Pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
Edit: Bonus image. Parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.
