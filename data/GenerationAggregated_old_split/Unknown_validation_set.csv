fj9dt8p,Worse than maccas? Sure mate,"Red rooster is the fucking worst fast food place by far. Where I grew up there where two one in the major shopping centre and ones about a minute away outside. The outdoor one was always dead never saw a car in the drive thru. But the inside one had a line as long as hungry jack's, almost like people not wanting to wait in line decided to go there which then formed a line. There is a Chinese place, Maccas, KFC and a bunch of smaller food places in the same food court aswell. But always a line at red rooster.",iro,reddit

fj7ycpm,The religious mobs are into this rort big time. And even though the catholics were busted rorting the system (claiming shit they didn't do.. on top of doing fucking nothing anyhow) - there was no repercussions whatsoever. Just more cheques from tax system to allow them to keep expanding their rorts.,"I went off at my JobSearch provider. The one you’re with gets $500+ per jobseeker, only for them to be useless and I still had to find my own jobs anyway. I asked them “What exactly do you do?!”. 
I literally got no help from them and Centrelink pays them to help me! It’s literally a cash grab.

fjcbl8o,Well said.,"This is the Coalition's policy from the beginning, they obfuscate, blame others and then months after people care they finally admit the truth. This is for everything they do, all conservatives do it constantly.
Every problem caused by them is because of Labor, every bushfire is the Greens fault, every sports rort is a ""misunderstanding of the law and in no way corruption"", every coal-fired power plant an example of ""clean coal"", you halve a job and get two jobs for half the price, you get challenged by the media you don't like? They are lying we are telling the truth and their funding has been suspended. Every PM flung through a turntable? The Coalition is strong and some outdated anecdote about the Rudd vs Gilliard Years.
We have a happy clapper running the country, a corrupt and abusive police officer with a major authoritarian chip on his shoulder in charge of our borders. A sycophantic banker in charge of the economy who couldn't give a toss about poor people, a ratty jobs minister who hid behind a whiteboard when asked the tough questions. Yet people still vote for them, people who never have benefited under a Liberal government. People who have been stuck on less and less wages, poorer welfare, limited access to childcare and healthcare and everything they value in their lives but who do they choose to direct their blame towards? The government that has ruined our country for close to a decade or Labor and the Greens?
All these men and women do is get into positions of power and lie constantly, get cushy jobs, have expensive holidays and then they turn around to the struggling people below them and rip up all their support networks and benefits while buying up more and more and more and more and never stopping. Yet people still take them at their word because of the carrot dangling in front of them, vote for us less tax! Vote for us more money! Vote for us more energy! And then they achieve none of it and everyone just accepts they were lied to 4 years ago and everything is different at the next election because it's a different shitty face and name to check off. 
He should just resign, in fact they all should, if any of them had decency they would have tendered their resignations years ago but they won't because they want money and power and to be the elite special class while costing Australians billions and holding the economy hostage. We have given them so much power and sway over us that it honestly doesn't seem to matter to a lot of people in this country that corruption has been accepted as normal and cool. 
For every good politician working in Parliament to give their constituents a better life there are five other monsters working against them and they are winning constantly. These people shouldn't be leading the country, they should be in jail like any other person on the street would be for such crimes.",not,reddit
