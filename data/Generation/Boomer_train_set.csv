It sounds mostly political. Kind of curious to hear from people who are with raffwu and whether they're more effective at getting workers what they want.","The SDA is a union run by social conservatives that exists to exert power within the labor party rather than do what is best for their members.
>""The SDA is a tame cat union,"" says Paul Conway, secretary of left-wing Victorian meatworkers union. ""Its primary interest is not its members but numbers in the ACTU and ALP, getting its people into Parliament, having an impact on issues like same-sex marriage.""
>https://www.smh.com.au/national/why-is-the-union-that-represents-supermarket-workers-stopping-gay-marriage-20150430-1mwl32.html
You might have seen recently in the news the pro coal ""Otis Group"" group in labor. What you might have missed is that that group is predominantly SDA affiliated.
> What is perhaps most curious about the Otis Group, is the prominence of Members and Senators aligned to the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association—the Shoppies.
>Let’s go through the list: -
From the Senate:
>* Senator Ciccone: Shoppie.
* Senator Polley: Shoppie.
* Senator Kitching: an honorary Shoppie by virtue of her factional prowess.
* And, of course, The Godfather, Senator Farrell: Shoppie.
>From the House;
>* Daniel Mulino: Shoppie
* Nick Champion: Shoppie.
* Amanda Rishworth: Shoppie.
* Luke Gosling: Shoppie.
* And Anthony Byrne: a so-called ‘Mod’ which a new factional grouping that Guy Rundle
has described as ‘quantum-Shoppies: existing in two factional states simultaneously’.
>By my count, that’s basically half—of the pro-coal group of ALP parliamentarians
who are Shoppies.  And a number of these Shoppies are from places like South Australia, Northern Territory
and my home state of Tasmania where the coal industry is either quite small or non-existent.
>How very curious. Not from coal mining unions; not from coal mining states; but with the numbers in a pro-coal
faction. - The Otis Group could easy be known as the New National Civic Council.
What on earth are those Labor members who have found themselves in the Parliament because
of their affiliation with a union that represents retail workers doing spruiking for coal?
>https://youtu.be/vHIr1h_-qxc
Now you might not care about internal labor politics but what it means is that the SDA gives sweetheart deals to companies as long as they help sign up new members for the SDA which gives them more clout inside the labor party.
>A partnership was formalised with the SDA in 1971 when six major retailers, including Coles and Woolies, signed landmark “closed shop” deals under which companies would sign up their staff as SDA members on the union’s behalf. 
>https://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2016/shopped-out/
But it generally means that they don't care about fighting for their members once they are signed up. Nobody wants to make enemies of big companies if they are trying to angle into a cushy parliament job.
Which leads to things like this
>Coles workers have received pay rises of as much as $150 a week after a substandard wages deal between the shop assistants union and supermarket giant was replaced.
>...
>In 2016, the full bench of the Fair Work Commission found that deal failed the ""better off overall test"", the legal test that workers have to be paid more than the award.
>More than half the workforce was underpaid, evidence from Coles’ own expert showed.
>It took nearly another two years of legal wrangling after that Fair Work ruling for a new agreement to take effect. That deal now largely reflects the minimum rates of the award.
>Nelio Da Silva, who has worked for more than five years at Coles, now gets paid an extra $140 a week under the new deal.
>He recently joined the new union, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, whose secretary Josh Cullinan exposed the Coles deal in 2015.
>""'I was always after a union that represented me better,’’ Mr Da Silva said. ''They (SDA) are more conservative and that’s not me.''
>The SDA is well known for its conservative social positions whether on abortion, euthanasia and for many years on same sex marriage.
>It is the largest affiliate of the ALP and has substantial political sway in Labor and the ACTU.
>An Age and SMH investigation across 2015 and 2016 revealed SDA deals across fast food and retail left more than 250,000 workers paid less than the award and saved business at least an estimated $300 million a year.
>But despite that the fate of these workers has drawn little or no support from the broader union movement, even as unions have campaigned against penalty rate cuts, wage theft and flat wages.
>Ms Ramnac had been suspicious of the SDA after her manager at McDonald’s pushed hard for her to join.
>''When I went to McDonald’s they really pushed for the SDA, obviously I joined because I was a vulnerable young worker,'' she says.
>''Soon I realised, on my own terms, they weren’t doing much. When you’re not accountable, not transparent, I can’t trust you.''

fjcbjiu,Link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.,"There is a great deal of research done on the efficacy of homeopathy, and you can google some meta studies on the subject. From my experience, (and the studies support this), homeopathy works on several ailments that main stream medicine has difficulty in treating, like respiratory diseases such as asthma, especially in children. It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. So look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. But looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at one’s own peril. However, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark.",iro,reddit

fj53b3u,How do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? I want to experiment it but I'm also scared of it,"1)Get your dream recall up. This is the hardest part. You have to realize you’re dreaming so to do that you need to find Dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
You can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
Also practice all day awareness. Ask yourself randomly if you’re dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. There are lots. The easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) Practice different techniques. 
DILD-Dream induced. This one is the easiest but less reliable. By this point you should know some Dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights don’t work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice you’re dreaming. 
WILD- Probably the most reliable, but many people report Sleep paralysis with it.  It’s a wake induced LD. Essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during REM or closer to it. 
There are others too FILD- Finger induced, DEILD- dream exit induced. There’s tons but those are probably the most common.

fj9bdej,They are testing and they are isolating just not publicly announcing this.,"Just started watching Dr. John Campbell’s videos on YouTube, he’s a no bs approach to this ordeal and just telling the facts as we know so far. Just put out a video of global isolation and containment where he spoke about a paper in The Lancet. How to best control the outbreak by isolation of cases and isolation of the contacts of said cases. The R0 of Covid-19 is 2.6, meaning for every case, that person will infect 2.6 and so and so forth. 
So basically the paper is saying the only way to contain this is to slow the process as much as possible and completely isolate cases and contacts. Imo we’ve already fucked it with the way we’ve handled our first case. In a small country like ours it should be easier to contain but if not acted upon properly it can spread faster. I think we are gonna be at Italy levels in the coming weeks.
I’m not trying to fear monger because the majority of us should be fine but it’s so frustrating to see it not taken seriously by people.

Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe.
