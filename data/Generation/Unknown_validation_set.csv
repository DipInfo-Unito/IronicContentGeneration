fj62jxi,As a Muslim this is exactly what they want us to do- react with violence on a large scale. All it will achieve is with more innocent bloodshed and allowing the RSS-BJP terrorists to come back to power in 2024 with even greater majority by gaining the sympathy of the majority who will see them as saviors. The Sanghis basically use the Israel model of unity through hatred which works because most Indians(including Muslims) are communal in nature irrespective of educational background. The problem is not Hinduism or Islam. No religion encourages violence or hatred. The issue is the politics of this country depend on the exploitation and brainwash of it's naive population who blindly believe the Divider in Chief as long as he makes bullshit promises of safety and prosperity and no matter how many times he fucks them they will gladly bend over and take it. Hitler used the same type of propaganda the Sanghis use and if people don't think it works- have a good look at the state of this country.,"True. Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. If they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. Bhagat Singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter.",iro,reddit

fjal1xy,">Rest whole article is just roaming around the point making useless conclusions. And shit like ""she used a Sanskrit word, vhp also uses the Sanskrit word, so she's clearly RSS"" when conveniently omits the dact that many from  MMS to Pranav Da have used a common Sanskrit word.
What are you talking about?? What article are you referring to? There is nothing in any of the articles I've posted about Sanskrit words!","Though you should've already known that Pieter is barely regarded high in journalists circles, lemme go through his stuff again.
The Caravan article is behind paywall, please post full text. This is cited as source many times in his every piece when ever he gives actual links to RSS.
The Quint article is by same author, and instead of providing proof of links, he is again clutching at straws. Not criticizing the RSS doesn't mean she is RSS, by this logic Kejriwal is supporter of RSS backed violence in Delhi.
Rest whole article is just roaming around the point making useless conclusions. And shit like ""she used a Sanskrit word, vhp also uses the Sanskrit word, so she's clearly RSS"" when conveniently omits the dact that many from  MMS to Pranav Da have used a common Sanskrit word.
Also, the author seems very, very angry about her tussle with Hillary for some reason, despite it's clearly Hillary in the wrong for making baseless accusations against some of her fellow dems to favor her friends.
Intercept is, well, Intercept. No source, no facts, just how they like it.
That said, please post the Caravan article which provides source of the RSS backing & funding as Pieter claims.",iro,reddit
